Linking the Development job with the Testing job
=====================================================
The development job has to be linked with the Testing job
so that once all the stages defined in the Development job are
done it should automatically trigger the Testing job
This is called as upstream/downstream config

1 Open the dashboard of jenkins
2 Go to the Development job--->Click on Configure
3 Go to Post Build actions
4 Click on Add Post Build action
5 Click on Build other projects
6 Enter project name as Testing
7 Click on Apply--->Save
8 Go to the dashboard of Jenkins
9 Go to the Development job---->Click on Build icon
  This will execute the first 3 stages defined in the Development 
  job and then it will execute the Testing job

========================================================================

Copying artifacts from Development job to Testing job
------------------------------------------------------
The artifact is getting created in the second stage of CI-CD
by the Development job so it will be present in the workspace
of the Development job.From here we should pass it to the
workspace of the Testing job

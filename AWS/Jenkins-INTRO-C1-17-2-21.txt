Jenkins
==========
This is a tool for implementing for CI-CD

Stages in CI-CD
===================

Stage 1 Continuous Download
===============================
Developers create some application code and upload in the version
controlling system,whenever code changer are done and uploaded
jenkins will get a notification and it will download that code
This is called continuous download

Stage 2 Continuous Build
==============================
The code downloaded in the previous stage has to be converted into 
an artifact.This is done by jenkins with the help of plugin like
maven,ant.msbuild etc.The outcome of this build is an artifact is 
generated

Stage 3 Continuous Deployment
===================================
The artifact created in the previous stage has to be deployed in the
testing environment and this environment can be running on some 
applications servers linke tomcat,jboss,weblogic etc.Jenkins will
deploy the artifact into these application server so that testers can 
start accessing the application.

State 4 Continuous Testing
=============================
Once the application is deployed into the testing environment Jenkins
will execute the automation test scripts created by testers.These test
scripts could be created using any tool like Selenium,Codedui etc.
Jenkins runs these automation test scripts and checks if the application
is working correctly.If it is not jenkins will notify the developers via
automated emails and Developer will modify the code and upload it again
into the version controlling system.Jenkins will again start from stage 1

Stage 5 Continuous Delivery
==================================
In this stage Jenkins will deploy the artifact into the prodservers where
the enduser or client can start accessing it.This is generally donw after 
taking approvals from the concerned team.

Note: The first 4 stages are called Continuous Integration
The last stage is called Continuous Delivery
